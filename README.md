# Per-Line Extraction Tool

An application that makes extracting specific items from a folder easier.

<h1>Liam Caust's Extraction Tool.</h1>

<h2>Designed with Galvins in mind! This application can:</h2>
- Take a per-line list of items, regardless of extension (Eg. .ico, .png, .exe) copy, and then paste into a new folder.
- Select Folder visually via File Explorer when selecting "Select Folder"

<h2>How to use</h2>
- Enter the first folder, this is the folder that you would like the application to look in.
- Enter the second folder, this is the folder that you would like to paste the listed files in to.
- Enter item/s, these items must be per-line and must be case-sensitive to assure we get the right files.
